# Dissertation-Project
My masters dissertation where I attempted to create an audio Deep Fake detector

Dataset can be downloaded from:

http://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~bil/Datasets/for-2sec.tar.gz

After downloading to the Data folder the data needs to be unzipped before being used

Comments in each code file explains how the model can be trained and used
A more detailed explaination will be provided here in the future once I have time to write one.
